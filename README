About
-----

This wrapper class allows you to retrieve images back as a PHP object from the Panoramio data API.

Usage
-----

At its most basic simply:

* Include and then instansiate the Panoramio wrapper class in your code
* Set the longitude and latitude of the location you would like to collect images near with the setRequiredLocation method
* Then call the getPanoramioImages to actually contact the API and request images for the location

See Code/example.php for very basic example of how the class can be used using the default co-ordinates for Sydney, Australia.
